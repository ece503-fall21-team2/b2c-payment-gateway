1.Install Express.js for the server and node-postgres (pg) to connect to PostgreSQL.Now we have our dependencies loaded into node_modules and package.json.
2. After setting the app listen to the port we have chosen, From the command line, we can start the server by hitting index.js.
     node index.js
     App running on port 3000.
   Go to http://localhost:3000 in the URL bar of your browser, and you’ll see the JSON we set earlier.
3.Now with just these two files index.js and queries.js, we have a server, database, and API all set up. You can start up the server by hitting index.js again.
     node index.js
     App running on port 3000.
  Now if you go to http://localhost:3000/users or http://localhost:3000/users/1, you’ll see the JSON response of the two GET requests. But how can we test our POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
